# Set up
```{r packages-and-data, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # general use
library(here) # file organization
library(janitor) # cleaning data frames
library(readxl) # reading excel files
library(flextable) # reading in the flextable package

sleep_data <- read_xlsx( #reading in an excel file
  here("data", "ENV S_193DS_data.xlsx") #file path to personal data 
)

```

# Problem 1. 

## a. 

I could calculate the mean number of hours slept to compare average hours slept on days that I have class compared to days that I don't have class. This is because I think that having classes the following day makes me more anxious the night before, and therefore makes me sleep less.

## b. 

```{r visualization}
sleep_sum <- sleep_data |> #start with sleep_data dataframe
  group_by(class_day) |> #group by class day (yes or no)
  summarize(mean = mean(hours_slept)) #calculate the mean

ggplot(data = sleep_data, #using the sleep_data data frame
       aes(x = class_day, #make the x-axis class day
           y = hours_slept, #make the y-axis hours slept
           color = class_day)) + #coloring points by class day
  #first layer: showing underlying data
  geom_jitter(height = 0, #no jitter in the vertical direction
              width = 0.1, #smaller jitter in horizontal direction
              alpha = 0.4, #make the points more transparent
              shape = 21) + #make the points open circles
  #second layer: showing the summary (mean)
  geom_point(data = sleep_sum, #using sleep data dataframe
                  aes(x = class_day, #x-axis is class day
                      y = mean)) + #y-axis is the mean
  labs(x = "Class day", #label x-axis
       y = "Hours slept",) + #label y-axis
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Yes" = "darkorchid3",
                                "No" = "tomato3")) + #change from default colors
  theme_bw() + #use a preferred theme
  theme(legend.position = "none") #remove legend
```

## c. 

Figure 1. Nights that don't precede a class day tend to have a higher mean hours slept. Points represent observations of number of hours slept on days that I have class (n = 22) and days that I do not have class (n = 8). Colors represent class days and non-class days (red circles: non-class day, purple circles: class day). The mean hours slept are shown for both types of day as the filled-in points. Data collected in Spring 2025 for ENVS 193DS class.

## d. 

```{r table presentation}
sleep_sum |> #using summary dataframe
  mutate(Mean_hours_slept = round(mean, 1)) |> #round the mean
  select(class_day, Mean_hours_slept) |> #select the class day column and the rounded mean
  rename( #rename to readable text
    "Class day" = "class_day", #rename class_day to Class Day
    "Mean hours slept" = "Mean_hours_slept" #rename Mean_hours_slept to Mean hours slept
  ) |> 
  flextable() #add this to a flextable and display
```
# Problem 2.

## a. 

For my personal data, an affective visualization could look like a drawing that conveys emotion, where the priority is creativity and novelty. I am thinking to draw a brain in the middle of a paper, and then draw brain waves that occur during sleep coming out from the brain. The brain waves will fill the whole rest of the page, giving the brain a sun-like appearance. Each brain wave will represent one observation, the frequency will represent how many hours I slept, and the color will indicate a class day or non-class day.

# Problem 3. 

## a. 

Multivariate logistic regression tests are included in this paper. The response variable is at-vessel mortality. The predictor variables include body length, hooking duration, time of capture, hook position, hooking temperature, and dissolved oxygen at capture. 

![](IMG_3780.png)
The x-axes of these figures are body length and hooking temperature. The y-axes of both figures are survival probability, which is another way of demonstrating at-vessel mortality. The figure is showing the effects of body length and hooking temperature on the survival probability of oceanic whitetip individuals. Larger individuals had a better chance of survival, and as hooking temperature increased, the odds of survival also increased.

## b. 

The authors clearly represented their statistics in the figure. The x-axes and y-axes seem to be in logical positions with informative units. The sample sizes are given at the tops of the figures. A model prediction is shown, within the underlying collected data shown as black circles on the same figures. The 95% confidence interval is shown as the purple shaded region. The figures were positioned next to each other for easy comparison of these two predictor variables. 

## c. 

The authors seem to handle visual clutter well. The data:ink ratio is good, as almost all the elements that are shown serve the purpose of conveying information. The gridlines are taken out and there is no background color. The colors of the model prediction and the confidence interval don't clash with each other or the background, and are easy to interpret. The figure is easy to interpret within the first couple seconds of viewing the figure. 

## d. 

I recommend moving the sample sizes to the corners of the figures. This is because it is in the place that a title would be, which seems to draw more attention to it than other more-important parts of the figure. I would not remove it since it is a valuable statistic to share. I also recommend removing the tick marks on the axes. This will make the figures even less visually cluttered than they already are. Also, I recommend making the black points that represent individual data points more transparent, so that points that overlap are easier to interpret. In the figure caption, I would convey what the purple shaded region and the red line represent in the caption, so that a reader that is less experienced with models does not have a hard time interpreting it.
