# Set up
```{r packages-and-data, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # general use
library(here) # file organization
library(janitor) # cleaning data frames
library(readxl) # reading excel files
library(flextable) # reading in the flextable package

sleep_data <- read_xlsx( #reading in an excel file
  here("data", "ENV S_193DS_data.xlsx") #file path to personal data 
)

```
