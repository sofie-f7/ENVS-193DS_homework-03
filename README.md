# ENVS-193DS_homework-03

## General information

This repository is for all work done for homework 3.

This is mine (sofie-f7), and I am the only contributer. 

The data was collected by me.

## Data and file information

There are two folders, a code folder and a data folder. All code is in the code folder, and my personal data is in the data folder. 

In the code folder, there is a file called "homework_03.qmd" that contains all code for this analysis. The code folder also has some images that I have added to homeworld_03.qmd for easy access.
